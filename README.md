# University Transport Management System (UTMS)

This project is a Java-based prototype for managing transport at Victoria University, submitted as part of the Object-Oriented Programming coursework.

## âœ… Implemented OOP Concepts

- **Abstraction**: Abstract `user` and `vehicle` classes used to define templates
- **Encapsulation**: All data is private and accessed using getters/setters
- **Inheritance**: `student`, `lecturer`, and `transportofficer` extend the base `user` class
- **Polymorphism**: Overridden `requestTransport()` method behaves differently per user
- **Interfaces**: `schedulable` and `trackable` define behaviors implemented by `bus`, `van`
- **Method Overloading**: `assignDriver()` is overloaded based on parameters
